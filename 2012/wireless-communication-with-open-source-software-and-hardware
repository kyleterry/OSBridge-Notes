radio is everywhere (GSM, bluetooth, tirepressure, monitors, rfid)

the point:
    information transfer

antennas work line transformers (kinda)

- source of noise
    - multi-path interference
    - the sun
    - wiggly electrons

- modulation
    kind of data
    how far
    how reliable

spread spectrum
frequency hopping

- components
    - antennas
        - vertical, whip, dipole
    - mixers
    - filters
    - amplifiers

- digital enables software... awesome
- digital can do things analog can't

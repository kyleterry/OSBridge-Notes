Queues are everywhere. Yep.

Why?
====
* Scale out
* Concurrency
* Async
* Resource Specialization
How?
==
* Local (shared memory)
* Clustered (LAN)
* Distributed (WAN, cloud)
Network chattiness
=================
* How chatty is the queue? This matters. Less round trip times.

Broker vs brokerless
==================
* Brokers
* * Brokers are a point of failure
* * provides retry abilities
* Brokerless
* * Brokerless is only one hop
Security
=======
* Queues don't really come with security
* Assumes you are in a trusted network
* Homebrew security?
* privies
* Piping through SSH. haha, awesome.
Poll vs Push
===========
* Polling sucks. GROSSSSSS
* Push is better, tells client that it's ready
* Chattiness matters here again

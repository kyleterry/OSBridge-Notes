json fails:
 - naming of keys is the only semantic channel available
 - links aren't first-class representations

rdf:
 - specifies a resource (with a URI)
 - describes it with subject-verb-object triples (e.g. [PSU, is a, university])
 - triple stores sit on top of regular dbs

RDFa:
 - <label about="..." adds the about attr to describe semantic

quad store:
 - adds "where the data came from" to the rdf triples

RDF Schemas:
 - subclassing, subpropertying
 - more like sets

ontologies:
 - describes relationships between classes more than instances
 - off-the-shelf ontologies can be downloaded  http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod
